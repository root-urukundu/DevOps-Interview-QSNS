# How to explain:

# Top level play: runs on group webservers from inventory.

# become: yes – use sudo for tasks.

# First task: apt module installs nginx package.

# Second task: service module makes sure nginx is running and enabled at boot.

# Highlight idempotent: running the playbook again doesn’t break anything.

# Command you can mention:
# ansible-playbook -i hosts web.yml
