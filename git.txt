MERGE:
- Combines branches and creates a NEW merge commit.
- Preserves full history as is.
- History becomes non-linear (multiple branches).
- Safe for shared branches like main/dev.

REBASE:
- Re-applies your commits on top of another branch.
- Rewrites history: creates NEW commit IDs.
- Linear history (clean).
- Use only on local/feature branches, never on shared team branches.

2) What is Cherry-pick?
---------------------------------------------------
- Cherry-pick applies a specific commit from one branch to another.
- Used to move a FIX or HOTFIX without merging the whole branch.

git cherry-pick <commit-id>

RESET:
- Moves branch pointer backward.
- Can delete commits.
- Dangerous on shared branches.
Types:
  soft  -> keep changes staged
  mixed -> keep changes unstaged
  hard  -> delete changes completely

REVERT:
- Creates a NEW commit that undoes an old commit.
- Safe for production/main branch.

Merge conflict happens when:
- Two branches modify the same line
- Or one deletes a file while another updates it

Conflict markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
incoming changes
>>>>>>> feature/login

Steps to resolve:
1. Open file, remove conflict markers
2. Keep correct code
3. git add <file>
4. git commit (or git rebase --continue)

Explain Branching Strategy in your project.
---------------------------------------------------
Say this (standard real-time workflow):

main/master → production  
develop     → integration / QA  
feature/*   → individual dev branches  
release/*   → pre-prod  
hotfix/*    → urgent fixes to production  

Flow:
- Developers create feature branches from develop.
- Create PR → merge to develop.
- Release branch created → tested → merged to main.
- Tags added on main for versioning.
- Hotfix branches created from main, merged back to main + develop.
